# Quantum Programming with Qiskit - QBronze156

Welcome to my repository dedicated to Quantum Computing, where I showcase the skills and projects I’ve developed through the QBronze156 workshop, organized by QWorld. This repository includes quantum circuits, algorithms, and practical applications that I created using Qiskit and the knowledge I gained during the workshop.

## About QBronze156

I successfully completed the **QBronze156** Quantum Computing workshop by QWorld, where I explored the fundamentals of quantum mechanics, quantum algorithms, and how to implement them using Qiskit. Some of the core topics covered include:

- **Superposition and Entanglement**  
- **Grover's Algorithm**  
- **Quantum Coin Flipping**  
- **Quantum Tomography**  
- **Superdense Coding**

The workshop allowed me to work with real-world quantum problems, visualizing quantum measurements, and understanding quantum behavior using Qiskit. This repository includes the projects I’ve built during this workshop, demonstrating my journey through quantum programming.

##  Projects and Implementations

This repository contains practical implementations and experiments based on the following topics:

### 1. **Quantum Coin Flipping**
   - A quantum version of the classic coin flipping problem, demonstrating quantum randomness and superposition.

### 2. **Quantum Tomography**
   - Understanding the state of a quantum system by measuring it multiple times to infer its properties.

### 3. **Superdense Coding**
   - A quantum communication protocol that allows sending two bits of classical information using only one qubit.

### 4. **Grover's Algorithm**
   - A search algorithm designed to find a target element in an unsorted database faster than classical algorithms.

### 5. **Two-Qubit Systems**
   - Hands-on experiments with two qubit states, demonstrating entanglement and quantum gates.

##  My Journey

Working with two qubits and visualizing quantum measurements has been one of the most exciting aspects of my quantum computing exploration. Through practical experience, I was able to develop quantum approaches to real-world problems, gaining insight into how quantum computing could revolutionize fields like cryptography, optimization, and AI.

##  Tools and Technologies

- **Qiskit**: IBM’s open-source quantum computing framework used to build and simulate quantum circuits.
- **Python**: Used for programming quantum circuits and algorithms.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive development and visualization of quantum states and measurements.
